What the odin-recipes project is:

This short project will be designed to put my new learned skills of using 
HTML and CSS to the test.
My web page will display information on 2 desserts. after a user selects a desert,
they will be led to a different page displaying the ingredients, method and nutrition.
 
I will be using text editor to write my code with html format. 
starting time: 11/02/2023

Overview on finished result:
This project was a success, it accomplishes what I had intended the site to do.

What I have Accomplished:
I learned the basic foundations of how html works.
I now have a much better understanding of what the tags and elements
do and how the work inside each other.
