# odin-recipes

What the odin-recipes project is:

This short project will be designed to put my new learned skills of using 
HTML and CSS to the test.
My web page will display information on 2 desserts. after a user selects a desert,
they will be led to a different page displaying the ingredients, method and nutrition.
 

My concerns for this project is:

connecting the files and directory's together.
connecting my recipe page to my homepage. 
adding images and detailed descriptions.

I will be using text editor to write my code with html format.

What I have Accomplished:

do and how the work inside on another.
